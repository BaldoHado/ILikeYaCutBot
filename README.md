To run this model, you must clone the repo locally and have tensorflow downloaded as well as all other related requirements. 
Next, download the weights of the [ASM Model]([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-6ii-jypJnKnbaXnXCbuzHqxEsBYrJIa/view?usp=sharing])[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-6ii-jypJnKnbaXnXCbuzHqxEsBYrJIa/view?usp=sharing]

```python ilyc_bot.py```
